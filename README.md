# Coursera Reproducible Research Project 2

This project analyzes [National Weather Service storm data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf) to meet the requirements for the second project for the Coursera Reproducible Research class.

Data were provided by Coursera but it looks like they can also be found at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/.
